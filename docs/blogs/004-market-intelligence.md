# Blog #004: Market Intelligence & Price History Tracking

*Date: August 26, 2025*

## From Raw Data to Market Intelligence

With 348+ watch listings properly categorized, we shifted focus to the core value proposition: transforming raw pricing data into actionable market intelligence through sophisticated price history tracking and trend analysis.

### Price History Service Architecture

**PriceHistoryService** - The brain of our market intelligence:
```python
class PriceHistoryService:
    def record_price_change(self, listing: WatchListing, previous_price: float):
        # Calculate price change metrics
        price_change = listing.price_usd - previous_price
        price_change_percent = (price_change / previous_price) * 100
        
        # Store historical record with comparison key
        history_record = PriceHistory(
            comparison_key=listing.comparison_key,
            price_usd=listing.price_usd,
            previous_price=previous_price,
            price_change=price_change,
            price_change_percent=price_change_percent
        )
```

### Market Analytics Engine

**Real Arbitrage Detection**:
```sql
SELECT 
    comparison_key,
    brand, model,
    COUNT(*) as listings_count,
    MIN(price_usd) as min_price,
    MAX(price_usd) as max_price,
    MAX(price_usd) - MIN(price_usd) as profit_potential
FROM watch_listings 
WHERE comparison_key IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY comparison_key, brand, model
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2 
AND (MAX(price_usd) - MIN(price_usd)) >= 1000
ORDER BY profit_potential DESC
```
