    # Real-time search with variation grouping support

@app.get("/api/price-history-enhanced")  
def get_enhanced_price_history(comparison_key: str, range: str = "90d"):
    # Time-series data optimized for Chart.js visualization

@app.get("/api/source-listings")
def get_source_listings(comparison_key: str, date: str):
    # Complete transparency - actual dealer listings with URLs
```

## ü§ñ Automation Revolution: 24/7 Market Intelligence

### The Challenge
Transform manual scraping into intelligent, continuous market monitoring with actionable alerts.

### Implementation Architecture
```python
class AutomatedWatchMarketEngine:
    def setup_schedule(self):
        # Full update every 12 hours (6 AM and 6 PM)
        schedule.every().day.at("06:00").do(self.run_scheduled_update)
        schedule.every().day.at("18:00").do(self.run_scheduled_update)
        
        # Weekly comprehensive analysis
        schedule.every().sunday.at("07:00").do(self.run_weekly_analysis)
    
    def check_for_alerts(self):
        # Large price changes (15%+)
        # Arbitrage opportunities ($1,000+)  
        # Rare watches (Tiffany, Tropical, Spider, COMEX)
```

### Email Alert Integration
```python
# Gmail SMTP integration for market intelligence alerts
smtp_server = 'smtp.gmail.com'
username = 'jyushuvayev98@gmail.com'
# Real-time notifications for significant market events
```
