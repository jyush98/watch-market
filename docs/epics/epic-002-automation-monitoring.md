## Implementation Details

### Market Alert Types

**Large Price Changes**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM price_history 
WHERE timestamp >= yesterday 
AND ABS(price_change_percent) >= 15.0
ORDER BY ABS(price_change_percent) DESC
```

**Arbitrage Detection**:
```sql  
SELECT comparison_key, MIN(price_usd), MAX(price_usd),
       MAX(price_usd) - MIN(price_usd) as profit
FROM watch_listings
GROUP BY comparison_key
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2 AND profit >= 1000
```

**Rare Watch Detection**:
- Monitor for new listings with special edition keywords
- Track Tiffany, Tropical, Spider, COMEX variations
- Alert on collector-grade piece availability

### Email Alert Format

```
Subject: Watch Market Alert - 3 significant events detected

Watch Market Intelligence Alert - 2025-08-26 18:00

3 significant market events detected:

â€¢ ðŸ“ˆ Large price change: Rolex Submariner (1680-standard): 
  $12,995 â†’ $15,495 (+19.2%)
â€¢ ðŸ’° New arbitrage opportunity: Rolex GMT-Master (1675-standard):
  Buy $11,595, Sell $31,995 = $20,400 profit (10 listings)  
â€¢ ðŸ’Ž Rare watch detected: Rolex Submariner 1680 Tiffany & Co - $45,995

Update Summary:
â€¢ Scraped listings: 331
â€¢ New listings: 42
â€¢ Price changes: 8

Dashboard: http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html
```
