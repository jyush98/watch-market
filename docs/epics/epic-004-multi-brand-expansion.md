        'materials': ['platinum', 'rose_gold', 'white_gold', 'steel'],
        'limited_editions': ['tiffany', 'emerald', 'salmon_dial']
    },
    'audemars_piguet': {
        'models': ['royal_oak', 'royal_oak_offshore', 'code_11_59'],
        'sizes': ['33mm', '37mm', '39mm', '41mm', '42mm', '44mm'],

## Data Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Reference Number Complexity
**Problem**: Each brand has different reference number systems
- Rolex: 6-digit (116610, 126710)
- Patek: 4-digit + complications (5711, 5740/1G)
- AP: Model + material codes (15400ST, 26470OR)

**Solution**: Brand-specific parsing with regex patterns
```python
REFERENCE_PATTERNS = {
    'rolex': r'\b(\d{5,6}[A-Z]*)\b',
    'patek_philippe': r'\b(\d{4}(/\d[A-Z]*)?)\b',
    'audemars_piguet': r'\b(\d{5}[A-Z]{2})\b'
}
```

### Challenge 2: Variation Complexity Explosion
**Problem**: 10 brands Ã— 15 variations each = 150+ unique patterns

**Solution**: Hierarchical variation system
```python
class VariationHierarchy:
    brand -> model -> reference -> material -> dial -> complications
```

### Challenge 3: Price Range Diversity  
**Problem**: $500 Tudor to $2M+ Patek Philippe creates scaling challenges

**Solution**: Brand-specific price validation and outlier detection

## Market Intelligence Expansion

### Cross-Brand Opportunities
1. **Brand Arbitrage**: Omega Speedmaster vs Rolex Daytona alternatives
2. **Material Arbitrage**: Steel sports watches across brands
3. **Complication Arbitrage**: Annual calendars Patek vs JLC
4. **Investment Tracking**: ROI comparison across brands

### Advanced Analytics
```sql
-- Cross-brand market share trending
SELECT brand, COUNT(*) as listings, AVG(price_usd) as avg_price
FROM watch_listings 
WHERE scraped_at >= last_30_days
GROUP BY brand
ORDER BY avg_price DESC

-- Investment performance comparison  
SELECT brand, model,
  AVG(price_change_percent) as avg_appreciation,
  COUNT(*) as data_points
FROM price_history ph
JOIN watch_listings wl ON ph.comparison_key = wl.comparison_key
WHERE ph.timestamp >= last_year
GROUP BY brand, model
ORDER BY avg_appreciation DESC
